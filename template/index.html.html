        <strong>Coconut Oil:</strong> Just two tablespoons of coconut oil adds some moisture while keeping the bread light. 

    </li>
    <li> 
        <strong>Brown Sugar:</strong> I used Lakanto monkfruit for a healthier option, but light brown sugar will also work.

    </li>

        <strong>Egg: </strong> You'll need one large egg. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Applesauce:</strong> Unsweetened applsauce replaced the oil.

    Instructions  👩🏾‍🍳

    </li>

        <strong>Combine:</strong> Add half of the dry ingredients and blend on low spee until combined. Pour in the remaining flour mixture and the mashed bananas and blend on low, ensuring you don't overmix. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake on the center rack for 45 to 50 minutes.
