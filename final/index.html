                    <p>Sundown towns —  also known as sunset towns, gray towns, or sundowner towns —  are typically all white in population and exclude a specific demographic. They are known throughout the United States and Canada. In America, they are well known for excluding African Americans, but some have segregated against Jews and others.</p>

The data speculates some towns could still be segregated or exclude minorities due to the lack of reported minority population in the area.</p>
                        <p>Each town had different methods of excluding or segregating unwanted demographics. From violence to economic coercion, the white population would find any means to exile or push away African Americans or other uninvited demographic groups.</p>

                            Otherwise, “they threw things at us, called us ‘nigger,’

                        <p>I and my husband David Koopman, both European Americans, moved to Greenbelt Maryland in
                            December 1963 from Ann Arbor, Michigan where I had experience volunteering in fair housing

                            When we went to GHI (Greenbelt Housing) to sign the papers for purchasing our
                            home, I B Westway Rd. I inquired about the inclusion of African Americans as residents. The
                            response was, “Don’t worry about it, we don’t allow them in here.” Having explained that my
                            inquiry was about inclusion not exclusion of racial minorities, to an incredulous
                            GHI representative, we nonetheless did move into our duplex.</p>
